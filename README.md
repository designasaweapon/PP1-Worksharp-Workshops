## Wireframes

Wireframes for the Worksharp Workshops website were initially created using the Balsamiq tool. [Wireframes PDF](readmedocs/wireframes.pdf) 

Following our directive to prioritize a mobile-first approach, we began by crafting the wireframe for the mobile version. Consequently, there are certain deviations in the live version of the website to accommodate its content. To ensure a logical and user-friendly layout of the information, we ultimately opted for a one-page website design, enhancing the overall end-user experience.

## Design Choices

### Typography

The font family chosen for Worksharp Workshops was Allerta Stencil - Logo | Allerta - Headings \ Lato - Body Copy.
These san-serif fonts offer excellent readability and contribute to a clean and easily understandable design.

![FontAllerta](readmedocs/font-grab-1.png)

![FontLato](readmedocs/font-grab-2.png)

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is based on the corporate colours of our parent company, the [BLCK BRND](https://blckbrnd.net/ "BLCK BRND") agency.

![Colour Scheme](readmedocs/palette-grab.png)

We also used [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ "Contrast Grid") to get inspiration for colour combinations to make the website visually attractive and accessible.

### Logo and Images

The website logotype is in vivid magenta and is complimented by a favicon utilising the stencil "W"taken from it.
Additional images sourced from the internet were integrated to enhance the content of the website. 
Each of these images has been equipped with alt tags to ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines. 
Furthermore, larger images sourced from online image banks have been compressed / optimized / converted to the preferred format the overall performance of the website. This was done using my own licenses for Adobe Photoshop 2024 and combines with various visual elements to contribute significantly to an engaging UX across the entire website.

### Structure

The Worksharp Workshops website is designed to be responsive, adjusting its layout based on the viewport size, as specified in the CSS media queries. This ensures that visitors can access the website in the manner I originally intended, regardless of the device type or screen size they are using. The breakpoints I have implemented align with Bootstrap standards.

# Testing

## Responsiveness Tests

We deployed the project a very early stage in order to test the responsiveness. We used mobile first approach and checked all changes on Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browser DevTools. External website [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/ "Responsive Design Checker") was used to test deployed versions. Another external source used was [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive "Am I responsive") website to get a single view of various device breakpoints.

![Responsive Design Checker](readmodocs/responsive-checker-grab.png)

I have also utilised Mobile Simulator extension on Google Chrome for extra specific device responsiveness testing.

## Code Validation

Worksharp Workshops has been validated via W3C HTML Validator and the W3C CSS Validation.

### HTML Validation

I have used [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/ "W3C HTML"). I have tested 3 html files. They all came back without errors.

### CSS Validation

The CSS code for the webpage was validated on [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "W3C CSS Validator").
It has now returned no errors after some considerble work.

## Accessibility Testing

We used the web accessibility evaluation tool [WAVE Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) which helps to determine if web content is accessible to individuals with disabilities. 

![WAVE](readmedocs/waves-grab.png)

In addition to conducting a WAVE test, I have also assessed my webpage for color contrast accessibility using the [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/ "Color Contrast Accessibility Validator"). Initially, an error was identified, but we have deeemed the contrast to be sufficient in the design and applies to only one element.

![Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](readmedocs/contrast-fail-grab.png)
